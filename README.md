# GitHub Explorer – Liquid Glass iOS App

GitHub Explorer is a SwiftUI iOS app that lets you quickly look up any GitHub user by username, see their profile details, and save your favourite profiles — all in a modern “liquid glass” (glassmorphism) UI.

## Features

- **Search GitHub users**
  - Enter any GitHub username and fetch their public profile.
  - See name, username, avatar, and bio.

- **Save favourite users**
  - Save profiles you care about to a local “Saved Users” list.
  - Quickly revisit the people you look up the most.

- **Modern liquid-glass design**
  - Blurred gradient background.
  - Glassmorphism cards using `ultraThinMaterial`.
  - Dark-mode friendly and built with SwiftUI.
